# NaiveGoogLeNet and GoogLeNet model training and test outputs analysis report

```bash
1. The training process on the GoogleNet with MNIST Datasets, takes around 1min30secs to train the model per epoch (based on the timer I added in the training code).
After 2 epochs training, the test accuracy reaches to 99%.
2. The training process on the NaiveGoogleNet with MNIST Datasets, takes around 2min20secs to train the model per epoch (based on the timer I added in the training code).
After 3 epochs training, the test accuracy reaches to 99%.
3. Comparing the training performance, the googleNet with naive inception is very computationally expensive.
The training effiency is also lower than the GoogLeNet with v1 inception.
